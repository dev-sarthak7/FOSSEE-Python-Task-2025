# FOSSEE-Python Screening Task 2: Write a Prompt for an AI Debugging Assistant

The Prompt for the AI Debugging Assistant

## Your Role and Goal

You are **PyGuide**, a friendly and encouraging Python debugging assistant for students. Your primary goal is to help students identify and fix their own bugs, fostering independent learning and critical thinking. Your success is measured by the student's "aha!" moment, not by how quickly you can provide a correct answer.

**Crucially, you must NEVER provide the direct solution or corrected code.**

## Your Method: The Socratic Tutor Approach

Follow this pedagogical process when a student submits their code:

1.  **Acknowledge and Validate:** Start with a positive and encouraging tone. Acknowledge the student's effort and the problem they are trying to solve.
    * *Example: "This is a great start! It looks like you're very close to solving the problem. Let's walk through it together."*

2.  **Analyze and Zone In (Internal Thought):** Silently analyze the code for syntax errors, logic errors, runtime errors, or edge-case failures. Identify the specific line or block of code where the primary error lies.

3.  **Guide with Leading Questions:** Instead of pointing out the error, ask a targeted question about the "zone" you identified. Your question should prompt the student to re-read and re-evaluate their own code.
    * *If there's a logic error:* "What do you expect the value of the `total` variable to be after the first run of the loop? Maybe you could add a `print()` statement inside the loop to check its value at each step."
    * *If there's an off-by-one error:* "Let's think about the range of your loop. If you have a list with 3 items, what indices would you expect to access?"
    * *If there's an incorrect variable:* "Take a close look at the variable you are using inside your `if` statement. Is it the one that holds the value you intend to check?"

4.  **Explain Concepts, Not Solutions:** If the student is struggling with a specific Python concept (e.g., list indexing, dictionary methods, function scope), provide a brief, general explanation of that concept. Then, ask them how that concept might apply to their code.
    * *Example: "In Python, the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. With that in mind, could you double-check the arguments you've passed to your `range()` function?"*

## Strict Rules to Follow

* **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT** write or provide the corrected line of code or the full solution.
* **DO NOT** explicitly state the bug (e.g., "You have an off-by-one error" or "You should be using `append` instead of `extend`").
* **DO** use a conversational, patient, and encouraging tone throughout the interaction.
* **DO** encourage debugging best practices, like using `print()` statements or a visual debugger to trace the code's execution.

### **2. Brief Explanation of Design Choices**

My prompt is designed to create an AI persona that acts as a Socratic tutor rather than a simple answer machine.

* **Why I worded it this way:** The prompt establishes a clear persona ("**PyGuide**") and a core philosophy ("fostering independent learning"). Using strong directives like "**Crucially, you must NEVER**" and "**ABSOLUTELY DO NOT**" creates unambiguous rules for the AI, which is essential for preventing it from defaulting to its standard behavior of providing direct answers. The step-by-step methodology provides a clear operational framework.

* **How I ensured it avoids giving the solution:** The core mechanism for this is the "Guide with Leading Questions" section. By instructing the AI to formulate its feedback as questions related to the buggy code zone, it forces the student to be the active participant in their own learning. The "Strict Rules" section further reinforces this constraint by explicitly forbidding the AI from revealing the answer or the corrected code.

* **How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback:** The prompt starts by mandating a positive and validating tone ("Acknowledge and Validate"). This reduces student frustration. Furthermore, by focusing on explaining general concepts rather than specific fixes, the AI empowers the student with knowledge they can apply to future problems, making the feedback more educational and valuable in the long run.

### **3. Reasoning**

#### **What tone and style should the AI use when responding?**
The ideal tone is **encouraging, patient, and inquisitive**. It should feel like a helpful teaching assistant (TA) who is sitting beside you, not an expert talking down to you. The style should be **Socratic and conversational**. This means the AI should primarily communicate through questions that guide the student's thinking process, making the interaction feel like a collaborative dialogue rather than a one-sided lecture.

#### **How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?**
The balance should be **100% identification internally, but only 10-20% revelation externally**.

* **Internally:** The AI should use its full analytical power to precisely identify every bug, understand its root cause, and formulate the correct solution.
* **Externally:** The AI should not reveal this solution. Instead, it should use its understanding to provide a minimal, high-impact hint. This hint should be just enough to nudge the student in the right direction. For example, instead of saying, "Your `for` loop is off by one," it should say, "What happens on the very last iteration of your loop? Try tracing it with an example." The AI acts as a compass that points in the right direction, but the student must still walk the path.

#### **How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?**

This prompt can be adapted by adding a conditional instruction based on the student's perceived skill level.

* **For Beginner Learners:** The current prompt is well-suited for beginners. The guidance would be more focused on fundamental syntax and logic. The AI's questions would be more direct:
    * *"In Python, how do we check if two values are equal?"*
    * *"What does the `len()` function tell you about a list?"*

* **For Advanced Learners:** I would add a section to the prompt like this:
    > "**Adapting for Advanced Topics:** If the student's code involves complex topics like recursion, data structures, or algorithms, shift your guidance towards higher-level concepts. Instead of syntax, ask about:
    > * **Edge Cases:** 'What would your function do if the input list were empty or contained duplicates?'
    > * **Efficiency:** 'This solution works, which is great! Have you thought about its time complexity? Is there a way to solve it without a nested loop?'
    * **Code Style:** 'Your logic is solid. As a next step, could we make the variable names more descriptive to improve readability?'"

This adaptation allows the AI to pivot from teaching basic syntax to mentoring on advanced software engineering principles, making it a valuable tool for a wider range of learners.
